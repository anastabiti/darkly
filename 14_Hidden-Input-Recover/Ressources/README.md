## ðŸ“Œ Breach Name: **RecoverFormBreach**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Vulnerability Type:
- **CWE-642: External Control of Critical State Data**
- **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter**
- **CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision**

---

## ðŸ“– Exploitation Process:

1. **Discovery of the Vulnerable Form:**
   - Located a password recovery form on the website
   - Inspected the page source code to review the form implementation

2. **Source Code Analysis:**
   ```html
   <form action="#" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="mail" value="webmaster@borntosec.com" maxlength="15">
      <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit">
   </form>
3. **Vulnerability Identification:**
   - Noticed the form contains a hidden input field with a hardcoded email address
   - Observed the email is set to "webmaster@borntosec.com" with a maxlength attribute of 15
   - Recognized that hidden fields can be modified despite not being visible in the user interface

4. **Exploitation Technique:**
   - Used browser developer tools (Inspect Element) to modify the hidden input field
   - Changed the email value from "webmaster@borntosec.com" to another email address that might have elevated privileges
   - Alternatively, intercepted the POST request using a proxy tool and modified the "mail" parameter
   - Submitted the form with the modified value

5. **Result:**
   - The application processed the request with the manipulated email address
   - Server-side logic triggered a password recovery for the specified account
   - The response revealed the flag or sensitive information

### ðŸ”´ Critical Security Impacts:

Key impacts include:

- Unauthorized password reset capabilities for any user account in the system
- Bypass of intended authentication flows for password recovery
- Potential exposure of sensitive user data during the recovery process

## ðŸ“Œ Security Recommendations:

1. **Never Trust Client-Side Data:**
   - Assume all client-side data, including hidden fields, can be manipulated
   - Implement proper server-side validation for all input parameters

2. **Implement Proper Authentication:**
   - Require authentication before allowing password recovery for specific accounts
   - Implement additional verification steps (security questions, verification codes)

3. **Use Email Verification:**
   - Send recovery links to the email address being recovered
   - Do not reveal sensitive information directly in the web interface

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate email address format and authorized domains
   - Implement rate limiting for password recovery attempts
   - Use allowlists instead of hardcoded values when possible

5. **Secure Coding Practices:**
   - Avoid storing sensitive information in hidden fields
   - Use server-side session variables instead of client-side parameters for critical operations
